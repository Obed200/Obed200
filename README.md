University of Rwanda student
With more than three years of experience, I am a full-stack software engineer with a focus on backend programming with Pythin, Java, javascript, and cutting-edge AI tools.  Using technologies like Django, JavaEE, Node.js, Spring Boot, restful APIs, and databases like SQL and MongoDB, I create dependable and scalable solutions.  In order to increase productivity and produce clever solutions, I have also integrated AI tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and Cursor into development processes.  I'm committed to maximizing backend performance, resolving challenging issues, and producing significant outcomes for all projects.
In addition, I have experience in machine learning, UI/UX design, and software engineering.
