A student at the University of Rwanda
 I am a full-stack software engineer with over three years of experience, specializing in backend programming using Python, Java, javascript, and state-of-the-art artificial intelligence tools.   I develop reliable and scalable solutions using technologies like Django, JavaEE, Node.js, Spring Boot, restful APIs, and databases like SQL and MongoDB.   I have also included AI tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and Cursor into development processes to boost efficiency and generate creative ideas.   I'm dedicated to optimizing backend speed, overcoming difficult problems, and delivering noteworthy results for every project.
 I also have expertise in software engineering, UI/UX design, and machine learning.
